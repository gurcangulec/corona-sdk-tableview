In Estonia banks give you an extra card that has many codes on it for you to use online banking. This can be considered as a security layer, but the thing is that you have to carry one more card with you to use online banking. If you use your ID card, then you don't need the extra codes from that extra card, but I don't always want to use my ID card and I want a simpler way to find the codes I want. So this reason I develop this mobile app with Corona SDK. With this app, I will be able to carry the codes on my phone and if I want to use them on my phone, I will be able to simply copy them by pressing on the code.
